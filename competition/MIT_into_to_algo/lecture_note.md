#### Lecture 1: Algorithms and computation
Goal
- Solve computational problems
- Communicate with humans
  - Prove correctness : prove by induction or recursion
  - Argue efficiency : time & space complexity
Algorithm is a procedure or function that maps arbitrary large sized input to output

RAM: random access memory [CPU can read from anywhere with given address]
- 32 bit : 2^32 ways to address RAM ~4GB
- 64 bit : 2^64 ways to address RAM ~ 20: Twice as much as all google data

#### Lecture 2: Data structure
- Store data with supported operations (Interface or API)
