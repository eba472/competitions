## Chapter 1: A FRAMEWORK FOR SYSTEM DESIGN INTERVIEWS (SDI)

Goal: simulate 2 coworkers collaborate on ambiguous problem => come up with solution
Open ended => No perfect answer: show design skills | defend your choices | respond to feedback constructively

SDI should tell:
- Ability to collaborate
- Work under pressure
- Resolve ambiguous

Possible red flags:
- Over-engineering: design purity and ignore tradeoffs


### A 4-step process for effective system design interview
#### Step 1 - Understand the problem and establish design scope
- Ask and think before talking
- Clarify requirement and assumptions
  - What specific features are we building?
  - Number of users & DAU?
  - How fast expect to scale up?
  - Existing tech stack?
