-- 1. 595. Big Countries
SELECT name, population, area FROM World WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000; -- OR operator and condition

-- 2. 1757. Recyclable and Low Fat Products
SELECT product_id FROM Products WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y'; -- string equal operator

-- 3. 584. Find Customer Referee
SELECT name FROM Customer WHERE 2 != referee_id OR referee_id IS NULL; -- WHERE omits NULL, so, we need to add by IS NULL

-- 4. 183. Customers Who Never Order
SELECT name as Customers -- use as to give different column name
FROM Customers c LEFT JOIN Orders o  -- LEFT JOIN: all rows in LEFT TABLE
ON c.id = o.customerId -- LEFT JOIN uses ON not WHERE.
WHERE o.id IS NULL; 

-- 5. 1873. Calculate Special Bonus
SELECT employee_id,  
CASE WHEN employee_id % 2 = 1 -- Filter by even, odd
AND -- Double condition 
name NOT LIKE 'M%' THEN salary -- Filter by string start
    ELSE 0
END AS bonus FROM Employees -- case statement as new column
ORDER BY employee_id ASC; -- order by

-- 6. 627. Swap Salary
UPDATE Salary -- UPDATE table_name
SET sex = -- Conditional set
(CASE WHEN sex = 'm' THEN 'f' WHEN sex = 'f' THEN 'm' END); -- CASE WHEN THEN 

-- 7. 196. Delete Duplicate Emails
DELETE FROM Person WHERE id % 2 = 1; -- Simple delete syntax
DELETE t1 FROM Person t1 JOIN Person t2 WHERE t1.id > t2.id AND t1.email = t2.email; -- Delete Join operation

-- 8. 1667. Fix Names in a Table

-- RIGHT(name, k) : Last k letters in string,
-- LEFT(name, k) : First k letters in string,
-- SUBSTRING(name, 2) : subString after k
-- UPPER, LOWER, CONCAT : String operations
SELECT user_id, CONCAT(UPPER(LEFT(name, 1)), LOWER(SUBSTRING(name, 2))) AS name FROM Users ORDER BY user_id ASC;

-- 9. 1484. Group Sold Products By The Date

-- PRIMARY KEY: Only one per table. UNIQUE values to identify, not NULL.
-- GROUP_CONCAT: combine multiple rows as string. 
    -- Distinct: It eliminates the repetition of values from result.
    -- Order By: It sort the values of group in specific order and then concatenate them.
    -- Separator: By default, the values of group are separated by (, ) operator. In order to
    -- Syntax: GROUP_CONCAT ( [DISTINCT] col_name1 [ORDER BY clause]  [SEPARATOR str_val] ) 

-- SQL aggregate functions:ã€€COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()
    -- Syntsax: SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country FROM Customers GROUP BY Country;
    -- GROUP BY: Obvious

-- 10. 1527. Patients With a Condition

-- WHERE LIKE operator
    -- The percent sign (%) represents zero, one, or multiple characters
    -- The underscore sign (_) represents one, single character
    -- WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%'	   Finds any values that start with "a"
    -- WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a'	   Finds any values that end with "a"
    -- WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%'  Finds any values that have "or" in any position
    -- WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%'   Finds any values that have "r" in the second position
    -- WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a_%'   Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 2 characters in length
    -- WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%'  Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length
    -- WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%o'   Finds any values that start with "a" and ends with "o"

-- MySQL REGEXP performs a pattern match of a string expression against a pattern.

SELECT * FROM Patients WHERE conditions like '% DIAB1%' OR conditions like 'DIAB1%'; 
SELECT * FROM patients WHERE conditions REGEXP '\\bDIAB1'
