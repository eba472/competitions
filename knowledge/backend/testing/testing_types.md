Ad-hoc testing : monkey testing 
- unstructured informal testing type: No documentation & No test case & design.
- Find defects by random checking.
- Error guessing : Guess and test most likely source of error by people who know the system well.
  
Regression testing:
- Re-running functional and non-functional tests to ensure that previously developed and tested software still performs after a change.
