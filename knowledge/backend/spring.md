### What is Spring?

Simply put, the Spring framework provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications.

It's packed with some nice features like Dependency Injection, and out of the box modules like:

Spring JDBC : Java Database Connectivity
Spring MVC
Spring Security
Spring AOP
Spring ORM
Spring Test
These modules can drastically reduce the development time of an application.



A servlet: a Java programming language class that is used to extend the capabilities of servers that host applications accessed by means of a request-response programming model.

Spring WebFlux: framework for non-blocking servers
- Handle concurrency with a small number of threads 


#### APM tools: Application performance monitoring
- Jennifer : Realtime Application Performance Manager
- Grafana  : Provides charts, graphs, and alerts for the web when connected to supported data sources.

#### Maven
- Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects.

#### Jenkins
- Automation server for building & testing & deployment: CI/CD
- Runs on servlet containers: Apache Tomcat


#### Tomcat
- Free & open-source implementation of Jakarta servlet
- Pure Java HTTP web server environment in which java code can run

#### Nginx 
- Web server | can be used as reverse proxy & load balancer & mail proxy & HTTP cache


#### API gateway
- API management tool (Acts as reverse proxy) sit between client and collection of backend services.
- Used for common tasks: user authentication & rate limiting & statistics, routing, billing, security
- Decouple client interface from api implementation. 

#### Proxy
- Forward proxy
  - Sits between internet and clients & intercepts
  - Use cases
    - Avoid firewall by connecting to proxy first and then internet. 
    - Block access to certain contents (School blacklists Facebook in proxy etc)
    - Protect identity: posting illegal things by proxy's IP address
- Reverse proxy
  - Sits between origin server and internet
  - Use cases
    - Load balancing
    - Protection from attacks: Never reveal IP address: Servers are safe from DDoS attacks
    - Caching
    - SSL encryption and decryption in one place


#### Security
A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic.
