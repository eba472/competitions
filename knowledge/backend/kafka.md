Apache Kafka is a distributed event store and stream-processing platform.

Kafka is fast : High throughput: large amount of data efficiently (Very large pipe)

How?
- Uses HDD: Reliance on sequential I/O (Append only)
- Focus on efficiency: Zero copy principle : 

2 types of disk access patterns:
- Random : Slow (Hva eto drag the arm to many places)  100KB/s
- Sequential : Fast (Next position is obvious)   100MB/s


HDD vs SSD
HDD (Hard drive) > SSD: 3 times cheaper with 3 times the capacity
